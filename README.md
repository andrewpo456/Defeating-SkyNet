+ Add code to dh/__init__.py
   1. What choice of parameters are you deciding on for DH?
   2. What's the proper way to calculate the private, public and shared keys?
+ Modify the way ciphers are used in lib/comms.py
   1. What's your choice of cypher? Why did you select it?

Notice: 'Test' and 'exit' are sent and received as the same encrypted message.
This means it's vulnerable to frequency analysis. When 'a' is sent multiple times,
it ends up "looping" as we're using a simple repeated XOR cypher.
This is something that should be fixed.
