Welcome to SkyNet
=================
Almost every device with a CPU in it has been connected to the internet. Whilst this is a 
stunning advance for hummanity, the security for these devices has come as an atferthought or not 
at all. Millions of computers and devices, all with valuable information and processing power 
are left vunerable to attack.

This project specifically looks at botnets: how they work, why they're valuable and why it's so 
difficult to defeat them.
Please note this project is intented for learning purposes only, it is not an operational botnet nor do 
we intend to create one. It has been created to help gain an understanding in how practical a massive cyber 
attack is and how complex it can be to defend against it.

Please note, that the premise of this project has been taken from the UTS subject 'Fundamentals of Security'.

TODO:
-------------------
+ Enable Signing and verification for any botnet updates
   1. Signing code in master_sign.py
   2. Verification code in the verify_file function in lib/files.py 
+ Ensure upload_valuables_to_pastebot securely encrypts data so it's only accessible to botnet master
   1. Need to modify master_view.py to allow the file to be decrypted by the botnet master
